# shell

For fun, I recently decided to revisit an old class project. Implementing a simple shell is easy, but impelemnting an efficient shell is not. In this project, I will be implementing a whole shell, with high emphasis on efficiency.

If you have recommended resources for shell design and efficiency, please feel free to send them my way!
